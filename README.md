ft_ls imitates the ls command.

The ls command is used to list files.
``ls'' on its own lists all files in the current directory except for hidden files.

ls options:
ls -a	                    list all files including hidden file starting with '.'
ls -l	                    list with long format - show permissions.
ls -la	                  list long format including hidden files.
ls -r	                    list in reverse order.
ls -R	                    list recursively directory tree.
ls -t	                    sort by time & date.
